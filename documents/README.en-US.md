- Open a new terminal and run the command `npm run dev`.
  > **💡 NOTE**: When you enter development mode. Some features may be disabled, such as sending statistics, updating data, etc.

## ☕ Serve

- Open a new terminal and run the command `npm run serve`.

## 🍵 Production

For actual use, the prepared command or set of commands can be used normally as follows:

- On Linux or MacOS

  ```sh
  # with command file (recommend)

  sh start.sh || sudo sh start.sh

  # or with call command

  npm start
  ```

  ./start.bat

  @REM or with call command

  npm start
  ```

### 🐳 Running on Docker

- Use the command `npm run docker:build` and wait for all the work to complete.
- Then open the Docker program and run it with the required environment information (env) or use the command `npm run docker:run` and wait until the bot is running.
  > **💡 NOTE**: You can check the functionality using the command `docker ps -a`.

## Quick Troubleshooting

### `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`

This problem may be caused by **Build tools** being installed incorrectly or may not have been installed yet. This problem can be solved by looking at the [installation](#1-install-build-tools) section.

### `@firebase/firestore: Firestore (10.6.0): GrpcConnection RPC 'Write' stream 0x58a118ce error. Code: 14 Message: 14 UNAVAILABLE: No connection established. Last error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8080`

It is possible that you have not yet simulated the database system on the machine in test mode. You can solve this problem by closing the bot and running the following command on another page.

```bat
npm run emulators
```
